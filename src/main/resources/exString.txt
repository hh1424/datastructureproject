1.Introduce yourself
Hi! My name is Hannah Hoffman. I am a freshman here at Guilford. 
I am a Cyber and Network Security major, and ever since I walked on campus, 
I wanted to become a Resident Advisor. My eldest sibling and my best friend 
were both RA's at their University. They spoke about how much fun they had as 
well as how much they learned about being on the opposite side of the line 
between Resident Advisor and Resident. I understand that an RA, in essence, 
has to wear many hats. That they are an accumulation of a bunch of roles wrapped 
into one young student leader working toward and hoping that they are making a 
difference in the lives of their residents. This is what I hope and strive for as well. 
Becoming a Resident Advisor would be a tremendous opportunity for me to use some 
of life's skills I have accumulated over the years. I am and have always been, an 
open-minded person. Always willing to listen to people's needs, concerns, questions, 
and ideas, I attempt to never give anyone advice or decisions that I would not take 
myself. Coming from a large family, I know how to set appropriate and secure boundaries. 
Along with helping others who are having boundary issues with their roommate or sibling. 
I am also willing to lend a hand to help someone. Whether that hand is at the grocery 
store; at home; at school; or on the road. I believe becoming a Resident Advisor will 
make it possible for me to work more on these skills I have mentioned, as well as gain 
more leadership experience. Growing up, I am the youngest amongst my siblings, and I've 
always had a big sister. I also have a best friend who is older than me who acts as an 
older sister as well. I have confided in them and place so much trust in them. They have 
also helped me in ways that I cannot even begin to repay them for. With all of these 
people helping me in my past, now I just want to give back what such a great gift was 
given to me and hope that I can inspire someone to do as well. Lastly, I am a member of 
the women's basketball team here at Guilford. In high school, I was a team captain and I 
always strived to talk to my teammates and make them feel included. If I become an RA I
would be able to meet and interact with other athletes or new teammates and make sure 
that they feel welcomed and happy on campus. 


2.Community Preference/ Study Away
I really do not have a preference in working with residents, however, I believe my efforts 
would be most suited for girls who are a bit younger than I am (more closer to my age - 
possibly first years). I also do not plan on studying abroad next year. 


3.Organization and Self-Management
Some of my greatest qualities are my organization skills as well as my time management skills. 
I grew up in a structured family. We - my siblings and I - knew always to wake up, eat and get 
dressed, and leave the house with enough time to get to school. We also were athletes and 
understood that school time and homework time was never a place to lack in. Schoolwork time 
is invaluable when you have practice, and work, and chores. Growing up in a structured family 
and being a student-athlete has taught me much about compartmentalizing, focus, drive, 
communication, work ethic, resiliency, time-management, critical thinking, mental toughness, 
and accountability. Each of these skills go hand-in-hand. I have the ability to manage and 
compartmentalize the work that I need to do for the week, and day, into sections to ensure 
that I complete everything accordingly. I understand that sometimes life gets in the way, 
so I have the mental toughness and resilience to bounce-back and push forward and get the 
job done. I also have the work ethic and communication skills to complete the tasks I have 
to do and speak with anyone if I am having trouble or concerns. I also know how to think 
critically and instinctively for any challenge that comes in my way. Lastly, I know how to 
keep people accountable, as well as myself. If I am doing something wrong or have done something 
wrong, I will admit it immediately. Everyone makes mistakes, and I believe that if you own up 
to those mistakes it makes you a better, stronger, person because you're willing to admit that
you are not perfect. And let's face it, none of us are, but if we are willing to admit and 
learn from our mistakes it will make it easier for us to change and adapt to anything that 
comes in our way. And this is what I hope to express to the residents if I become an RA. 


4.Inclusion
I always like to learn more about other people and the background from which they came from. 
Coming from a very diverse high school, I was always intrigued and interested in my friends' 
different and unique backgrounds. One of my friends is half Muslim and Arab. Originally, his 
family is from Sadi Arabia. Since meeting him, it has truly opened my eyes to different cultures.
I have learned that different cultures and origins act and talk in certain ways different from
others, such as myself. From spending time with him I learned that he and his family do not 
eat pork, and when they are home together they may not speak any English, only Arabic. Ever 
since meeting my friend I have become very observant of other people and their different 
cultures or background. I have become very open-minded and respectable to other people and
their culture or religion. My dad's side of the family is Jewish, and my mother's side is 
Christian. I have always been interested in learning Judaism and different religions for 
that matter. I love learning about people and their different cultures and religions. 
I believe it is significant that we learn about people's different cultures and religions. 
It helps you view life from a different perspective and helps you establish new ways of 
thinking and approaching and solving problems. A diverse and inclusive environment is 
beneficial for all because each resident is able to freely express who they are, their 
opinions, and their points of view. They feel safe and respected, and comfortable to be 
themselves and to express all aspects of their identity. They will share a sense of 
belonging with each other, and most importantly each resident has something unique to 
contribute to the hall, and their unique perspective and identity will be an asset to 
the hall and our community. 


5.Community
A community to me is established when two or more people share the same values, and through time, 
this personal connection evolves into a fellowship governed by rituals, traditions, and a particular
form of communication, that when taken together, makes a group of individuals whether living in a 
specific geographical area or connected by ideals so distinct that their distinguishing marks allow
them to stand out from among the crowd. In essence, I am attempting to say that a community is an 
accumulation of people from multiple diverse backgrounds (cultural orientations) coming together
expressing freely, who they are, their opinions, and points of view. A community is a place where 
its citizens and members feel safe, respected, and comfortable to be themselves and to express all
aspects of their identity unobstructed without persecution. Where people are able to share a sense 
of belonging with other members. In a larger sense, it is "home." In a community, everyone has 
something unique to contribute, and their unique perspective and identity are seen as an asset.
This is what I believe a community looks like and what I hope to express to the residents if 
I become a Resident Advisor. From multiple experiences, I have accumulated many notes on how 
to build, work towards, and express a community experience. I believe the simplest way to 
make community members feel included is to recognize everyone's uniqueness and give them 
the opportunity to express that uniqueness. Everyone has a voice; and if someone feels as 
if they do not have one I would help them work towards their confidence and make sure that
they always have a voice, no matter what. For this, I would make my room a free and safe 
place for anyone to come and discuss any concerns they have or if they just needed someone 
to talk to. A dorm is a college student's "home" for the year (or more), and I believe that
they have a right to act and decorate their "home" within the parameters Guilford College 
has implemented for us. "There is no boundary to express yourself in an appropriate manner." 
This is a quote I have heard in the past and I stand by it, and it's a great statement to 
express to residents. I am not afraid to make rules if needed, based on individual situations 
that reveal themselves. But the most important aspect of building a community is spending 
time with your members. If I were to be a Resident Advisor, I would give multiple opportunities 
for my residents to spend time together through multiple means of interaction. Given the opportunity. 
I believe becoming an RA would be a tremendous honor and privilege to represent Guilford College in this aspect. 


6.Programming
I have multiple ideas to bring my residents closer together. In regards to the 20 dollar budget, 
I have a few ideas such as a movie or karaoke night, outside recreational activities - such as 
frisbee, volleyball, soccer, cornhole, and more - board game night, tie-dye night, scavenger hunts, 
and holiday celebrations or hangouts. Having these events would give a sense of community in the 
hall and it would allow the residents to come together and grow closer and form bonds with people 
that they didn't know before. I would ask for the events to be hall residents only, however, if 
they would like to bring someone from another residence hall I would not mind as long as they abide 
by the rules Guilford College has implemented for us. I would like the location of the events to be 
either inside - in one of the common rooms in the resident halls - or outside in an area where there 
is enough room to where people could join or just have space to talk and hang out. Each of the events 
that I have mentioned is an opportunity for new residents to come together and talk and get to know 
each other. Given this past year, it has been hard for me to meet new people on campus, with having 
to stay in our dorm rooms and not being able to have in-person classes, and not being able to meet 
new people in our hall because we had to stay safe from the virus. I want new residents to have the 
experience I didn't get to have my first year at college because the friends and relationships that
you make in college stay with you for the rest of your life. 


7.Conflict Management
If two roommates in my hall were in an argument I would first ask them to meet with me for a sit-down 
discussion so we may come to a consensus on both sides of the story. I believe the best way to conduct 
this discussion is to bring both roommates into a safe and private room where they may speak freely. I 
would first ask one of the roommates to tell me why we are having this discussion, and once the first
roommate is finished answering, I would then ask the second roommate the same question and wait until
they are finished talking. We would then discuss matters of the issue, and I would refer to their 
Roommate Agreements (but if they do not have one then I would draft one for them). The best way to
handle an argument or a conflict, I believe, is to talk it out; say what is bothering you. It will
not do you or anyone good if you hold it in. I am the type of person who can never go to bed angry,
and I am always the one who needs to talk about conflicts in person, face-to-face. I want my residents
to come to me with anything that is bothering them, whether it be a roommate situation or something 
else. I want to be able to help my residents in any way that I can and I want them to know that if 
situations may arise.
If a group of my friends broke a major policy I would first approach my friends on the issue that is 
currently being presented. I would talk to them and bring up the issue first hand to where we could 
have a civilized discussion. If our discussion did not come up with an appropriate output, I would 
then resort to my supervisor or coordinator and discuss with them the next steps for handling the issue 
because the coordinator is a great resource if we could not come up with a solution by ourselves and 
needed further assistance. The coordinator is also unbiased and would add another perspective to the 
issue we are having and help us figure it out better. 


8. Working with Others
I believe that I am the leader of a group. My best friend describes me as “Funny, Charismatic, and Empathetic.” 
I listen to people's preferences and concerns and use that to help base decisions or jobs that would be most 
useful for everybody. I would not make or push someone to do something they do not want to do. However, 
I believe the statement "I can't" is an excuse. I would work and try to help people understand, and believe 
themselves, that nothing is impossible and that they have the capabilities to push themselves. College is about 
breaking out of your shell and forming new relationships with people. I would encourage my residents to break 
out of their comfort zones and try new things that they have never done before. From the experience of breaking 
out of my comfort zone, I have formed some of the closest relationships of my life as well as some of the most 
amazing experiences of my life, that will stay with me forever.
